# @rdfjs/fetch-lite

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rdfjs/fetch-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rdfjs/fetch-lite)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@rdfjs/fetch-lite.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rdfjs/fetch-lite)

Wrapper for fetch to simplify sending and retrieving RDF data.

This is a light version of the `@rdfjs/fetch` package, without the `@rdfjs/formats-common` dependency.
It is useful when you want to make a build for the browser with a reduced set of parsers and serializers.

The `formats` options is required for this package.
See also the `@rdfjs/fetch` documentation.

Since version 3.0, this packages is [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) only.
Check version 2.x if you are looking for a CommonJS package.

## Usage

The package exports a `fetch` function which wraps the request and response object for on-the-fly RDF quad processing.
The function accepts the same parameters as [fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) and some additional options. It also provides extra methods.

### Options

The `options` object accepts the following additional parameters:

- `formats`: A [formats-common](https://github.com/rdfjs-base/formats-common)-compatible object which contains a set of parsers and serializers.
  This parameter is required.
- `factory`: If given, the factory will be used to create a Dataset when `dataset()` is called.
  If the parameter is not given, the `dataset()` method will not be attached to the response.
- `fetch`: An alternative fetch implementation.
  By default [nodeify-fetch](https://github.com/bergos/nodeify-fetch) will be used.

The following `options` influence the logic of RDF quad processing: 

- `headers.accept`: The accept header field will be automatically set base on the list of available parsers from the `formats` object.
  If it's already set it will not be overwritten.
  This can be useful when only a subset of the available parsers should be used. 
- `headers.content-type`: When the request has a body, this header field will be automatically set to use matching media type for the corresponding serializer.
  By setting this field manually a specific serializer can be enforced.
- `body`: If the request should send quads, the quads must be given either as a stream or as an iterable.
  Iterables will be converted to streams before they are handed over to the serializer.

### Response

The following methods are attached to the standard fetch response object:

- async `quadStream()`: This method returns the quads of the response as stream.
  The parser is selected based on the content type header field.
- async `dataset()`: This method uses the `quadStream()` method to parse the content and will pipe it into a dataset, which is also the return value.
  This method is only available when the `factory` option is given.

The `Content-Type` header of the response can be changed or set before calling `quadStream()` or `dataset()`.
That allows enforcing a specific parser or can be used to fix a lacking header.

### Example

This example fetches data from a resource on Wikidata.
The stream API is used to process all quads.
For all `rdfs:label` quads of the defined entity, the object language and value will be written to the console.

```javascript
const formats = require('@rdfjs/formats-common')
const fetch = require('@rdfjs/fetch-lite')

const entity = 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2'
const label = 'http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label'

fetch('https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/Q2.ttl', { formats })
  .then(res => res.quadStream())
  .then(quadStream => {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      quadStream.on('end', resolve)

      quadStream.on('data', quad => {
        if (quad.subject.value === entity && quad.predicate.value === label) {
          console.log(`${quad.object.language}: ${quad.object.value}`)
        }
      })
    })
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err))
```
